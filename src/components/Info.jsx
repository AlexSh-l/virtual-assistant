                Everything began in the Himalayas. Me and my buddies decided to go on a hike to conquer Mt. Everest,
                even though the journey alone would probably kill us. Realising this, we decided to overcome our fears
                and reach the very top of this panic-inducing mountain. We made sure to be well prepared for anything on
                our trip, so we packed everything we thought would save our lives. Long story short, as i was climbing
                the razor-sharp icy mountains in freezing cold - a genius idea dawned on me: i should make a Website,
                that would help other people organize different events. And that's how this site came to be. During my
                trip I realised how important preparation was and this service is designed to help people organize
                events, though smaller in scale or responsibility, but spectacular nontheless.
